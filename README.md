🧠 Alzheimer's Detection using Deep Learning

📌 Overview

This project leverages deep learning to classify MRI scans from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset. We utilize multiple state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

🗂 Dataset

Source: ADNI Dataset

Preprocessing:

Images resized to 256x256.

Applied normalization and data augmentation.

Split into training, validation, and test sets.

🏗 Models Used

We employed multiple deep learning architectures with transfer learning and fine-tuning:

InceptionV3

DenseNet121

EfficientNetB0

ResNet50

VGG16

🎯 Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Normalization, augmentation, and resizing.

Feature Extraction: Transfer learning from pre-trained models.

Fine-tuning: Optimizing specific layers for better performance.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

🔬 Results

Best performing model: TBD (based on evaluation)

Performance comparison: Results compared across multiple CNNs.

🚀 Future Work

Implement self-supervised learning to reduce dependency on labeled data.

Integrate attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction.

Optimize model inference for real-time clinical applications.
